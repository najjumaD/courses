# Many things can be mentioned here such as the use of colors 
# (red/blue is not a good choice for color blind people), 
# the legend makes no sense as red and green both refer to \textit{sport}, 
# the label of `f' and `m' is not explained in the legend, 
# rotating the labels of the y-axis would increase readability, and 
# both axes do not start at zero which is hard to see. 
# Also, it is a common to draw the variable you want to explain 
# (here: calories) on the y-axis.

# 1) An increase of 100 calories (taken on average on a daily basis) is associated 
# - on average and ceteris paribus - with 2.69 more of kg the participants are 
# pretended to weight.   
# 2) The estimated coefficient $beta_1$ is statistically significantly different to zero
# on a significance level of 5%.
# 3) About 60 % of the variation of the weight is explained by the 
# estimated coefficients of the empirical model.

# 16
# For omitted variable bias to occur, the omitted variable `Z` must satisfy
# two conditions:
#   1) The omitted variable is correlated with the included regressor 
#   2) The omitted variable is a determinant of the dependent variable
