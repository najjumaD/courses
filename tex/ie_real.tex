\textbf{N. Gregory Mankiw }(*1958) is one of the most influential economists. In his best-selling textbook \textit{Principles of Economics} \citep[see][]{Mankiw2020Principles} he claims ten principles of economics of which one is entitled \textit{Trade can make everyone better off} which he explains as follows:

\pbn
\zitat{``You have probably heard on the news that the Japanese are our competitors in the
	world economy. In some ways, this is true, for American and Japanese firms do
	produce many of the same goods. Ford and Toyota compete for the same customers in the market for automobiles. Compaq and Toshiba compete for the same customers in the market for personal computers. 
	
	Yet it is easy to be misled when thinking about competition among countries.
	Trade between the United States and Japan is not like a sports contest, where one
	side wins and the other side loses. In fact, the opposite is true: Trade between two
	countries can make each country better off.
	
	To see why, consider how trade affects your family. When a member of your
	family looks for a job, he or she competes against members of other families who
	are looking for jobs. Families also compete against one another when they go
	shopping, because each family wants to buy the best goods at the lowest prices. So,
	in a sense, each family in the economy is competing with all other families.
	
	Despite this competition, your family would not be better off isolating itself
	from all other families. If it did, your family would need to grow its own food,
	make its own clothes, and build its own home. Clearly, your family gains much
	from its ability to trade with others. Trade allows each person to specialize in the
	activities he or she does best, whether it is farming, sewing, or home building. By
	trading with others, people can buy a greater variety of goods and services at
	lower cost.
	
	Countries as well as families benefit from the ability to trade with one another.
	Trade allows countries to specialize in what they do best and to enjoy a greater variety of goods and services. The Japanese, as well as the French and the Egyptians
	and the Brazilians, are as much our partners in the world economy as they are our
	competitors'' \citep[p. 8-9]{Mankiw2020Principles}}

\section{Reasons for trade}{\label{sec:reasons}\label{Reasons for trade}
	
	Before we come to reasons for trade in further detail, let us name five important explanations or reasons why trade takes place between countries. Of course, the list is incomplete.
	
	\paragraph{Differences in technology}
	Advantageous trade can occur between countries if they differ in their technological abilities to produce goods and services. Technology refers to the techniques used to turn resources (labor, capital, land) into outputs. The basis for trade in the Ricardian Model of Comparative Advantage is differences in technology. We will come back to this in \autoref{sec:ricardo} in more detail.
	
	\paragraph{Differences in endowments}	
	Trade between countries also occur because countries differ with respect to their endowments of resources which refers to the skills and abilities of a country's workforce, the natural resources available within its borders, and the sophistication of its capital stock such as machinery, infrastructure, and communications systems. The basis for trade in the pure exchange models (see \autoref{sec:exchange-economy}) and the Heckscher-Ohlin Model (see \autoref{sec:ho}) is differences in resource endowments.
	
	\paragraph{Differences in demand}
	Trade between countries occurs because the demands or preferences differ between countries. Individuals in different countries may have different preferences or demands for various products. The Asian people are likely to demand more rice than Americans, even if facing the same price. Czech and German people may demand more beer, the Dutch more wooden shoes, and the Japanese more fish than Americans, even if they all faced the same prices.
	
	\paragraph{Economies of scale in production}
	The existence of economies of scale in production is sufficient to generate advantageous trade between two countries. Economies of scale refer to a production process in which production costs fall as the scale of production rises. This feature of production is also known as \textit{increasing returns to scale}. Economics of scale play a huge role in Paul Krugman's \textit{New Trade Theory} which we discuss later.  
	
	\paragraph{Existence of Government Policies}
	Government tax and subsidy programs can be sufficient to generate advantages in production of certain products. In these circumstances, advantageous trade may arise solely due to differences in government policies across countries. We will touch the impact of tariffs and regulations in \autoref{sec:policy}.

	\subsection{Production possibility frontier curve}
	
	\begin{minipage}{0.6\linewidth}	
		The production possibility frontier curve (PPF) is a graphical representation showing all the possible options of output for two products that can be produced using all the given resources and factors of production are fully and efficiently utilized per unit time. The PPF is the boundary between the combinations of goods and services that can be produced and the combinations that cannot.
		The PPF is a valuable tool for illustrating the effects of scarcity and its consequences, as it can teach us a lot about production efficiency, opportunity costs, and tradeoffs between different choices. The PPF is (usually) concave because not all resources are equally productive in all activities.

			\item Any point that lies either on the production possibilities curve or to the left of it is said to be an attainable point: it can be produced with currently available resources. Production points that lie in the yellow shaded area are said to be unattainable because they cannot be produced using currently available resources. These points represent an inefficient production, because existing resources would allow for production of more of at least one good without sacrificing the production of any other good. An efficient point is one that lies \textbf{on} the production possibilities curve. At any such point, more of one good can be produced only by producing less of the other.

A straight-line (linear) PPF reflects a situation where resources are not specialized and can be substituted for each other with no added cost. With constant returns to scale, there are two opportunities for a linear PPF: if there was only one factor of production to consider or if the factor intensity ratios in the two sectors were constant at all points on the production-possibilities curve.

Together, they are isolated from the rest of the world for a few days due to a natural disaster. Fortunately, they both have additional access to an endless supply of sweet mustard and beer and they now wonder how to share pretzels and sausages the upcoming days. Let's assume that both of them accept only a white sausage eaten together with a pretzel. That is, eating two pretzels with a sausage is no better than eating a pretzel and a sausage. After some discussion, Barbara gives 5 pretzels and Anton gives Barbara 5 sausages in return. They strongly believe that there is no better way to share food.

	\subsection{Terms of trade}
	
	\boxb{
		The terms of trade is defined as the quantity of one good that exchanges for a quantity of another. In this case, how many apples can be exchanged for how many oranges? It is typical to express the terms of trade as a ratio. 
	}
	
	In the above example, the exchange of goods takes place at a ratio of 1:1. In economics, one speaks that the terms of trade are 1. The terms of trade is a ratio defined as the relative price of exports in relation to imports. In other words, the quantity of one good that can be exchanged for a quantity of another good. For example, how many sausages can be exchanged for how many pretzels.  The terms of trade, which are ultimately determined by the two trading partners, depend on a variety of different and distinct factors, including the following:
	
	\desx{
		\item[Preferences] For a trade to occur, each trader must desire something of the other good and be willing to give up something of his own good in order to obtain it. Put formally, the expected utility of eating a few slices of Anton's bread must be greater than the expected disutility of not eating a few of his sausages. The same logic applies to Barbara. In this case, extreme preferences were assumed. Normally, the two goods are not perfectly complementary, but substitutable.
		\item[Uncertainty]
		In this situation, both people have clearly defined preferences. Perhaps Barbara has never tried one of Anton's sausages, and Anton usually eats bread and not pretzels. A simple way to eliminate this uncertainty would be to offer free samples of their products before an exchange is agreed upon.  Without a sample, Anton and Barbara would have to make their exchanges based on their expectations of the taste of the other product. 	
		\item[Scarcity] The relative quantities of the two goods available for trade affect the terms of trade. Suppose consider pretzels and sausages not to be perfect complements and suppose Barbara has 1000 pretzels then the terms of trade would likely be different. 
		\item[Size]	
		The size of the goods is likely to affect the terms of trade. 
		\item[Quality] The quality of the goods will affect the terms of trade. Assuming the pretzels are old and hard, both individuals would likely prefer less than one pretzel per sausage.
		\item[Persuasion] If Barbara is a good salesperson and Anton is not, she may have the power to influence the terms of trade to her advantage.
		\item[Government Policy] Suppose a tax official is willing to impose a tax based on the quantities traded between Barbara and Anton, this is likely to influence the terms of trade. If the laws prohibit the two from meeting in person, they will not trade either.

	Trade is a decision to give up something in order to receive something in return. If this decision is made of free will, it must improve the situation of both participants in the trade (but not necessarily that of all those who are not involved in the trade in question).

	\section{More trade is not necessarily good (immiserizing growth)}\label{sec:imi}
	\itex{
		\item So far, I have implicitly assumed that the world market price is fixed and not changed by the entry of country H into the free trade market. When the latter is the case, economists speak of a small open economy (SOE). In general, a SOE is an economy that is so small that its policies do not change world prices. 
		\item Suppose that country H is not an SOE. What would happen to world prices if country H offered a lot of good $x_1$ to receive good $x_2$? Obviously, $\left(\frac{p_1}{p_2}\right)_W$ would fall. In the worst case, country H is so large that $\left(\frac{p_1}{p_2}\right)_W=\left(\frac{p_1}{p_2}\right)_A$. This means that country H has no benefits from free trade.
		\item Assuming that a (large) country cannot opt out from free trade and that the exporting sector grows, there is a theoretical scenario called \textit{immiserizing growth} that shows that free trade countries are worse off in the long run. This scenario is illustrated in \autoref{fig:immigrow}. The figure summarizes two periods. In the first period, country H produces at point B and consumes at point D, trading goods at world prices $\left(\frac{p_1}{p_2}\right)_W$. Then country H grows in sector 1. This is shown in the new production possibility curve TK2. If country H were able to trade at the old world price, it would be able to consume at point F. Unfortunately, country H is not a SOE, and therefore world prices (from country H's perspective) deteriorate to $\left(\frac{p_1}{p_2}\right)_W'$. This has bad implications for country H, since its optimal consumption is now at point D', which has lower welfare relative to point D. However, this is not an argument against trade, since the welfare at point D' is still above the production possibility curve in autarky, TK1.

			\item Specialization in production increases the price of exported goods for that country. As a result, prices converge. 
			\item A discussion of national competitiveness is not useful through the lens of the Ricardo theorem.

		\textbf{David Ricardo} (1772-1823), one of the most influential economists of his time, had a simple idea that had a major impact on how we think about trade. In \cite{Ricardo1819}, he argued that bilateral trade can be a positive-sum game for both countries, even if one country is less productive in all sectors, if each country specializes in what it can produce relatively best. 
		
		He introduced the theory of comparative advantage that is still an important corner stone of the modern theory of international trade\footnote{Actually, strictly speaking, this is not correct, since the original description of the idea can already be found in 1815 in the \textit{Essay on the External Corn Trade} by Robert Torrens. However, David Ricardo formalized the idea in his 1817 book using a convincing and simple numerical example. For more information on this, as well as a great introduction to the Ricardian model and more, I recommend \cite{Academy2012International}.} It refers to the ability of one party (an individual, a firm, or a country) to produce a particular good or service at a lower opportunity cost than another party. In other words, it is the ability to produce a product with the highest relative efficiency, given all other products that could be produced. In contrast, an absolute advantage is defined as the ability of one party to produce a particular good at a lower absolute cost than another party.
	\end{minipage}
	
\subsection{Defining absolute and comparative advantages}

A subject (country, household, individual, company) has an \textbf{absolute advantage} in the production of a good relative to another subject if it can produce the good at lower total costs or with higher productivity. Thus, absolute advantage compares productivity across subjects but within an item.

A subject has a \textbf{comparative advantage} in the production of a good relative to another subject if it can produce that good at a lower opportunity cost relative to another subject. 

	Let me explain the idea of the concept of comparative advantage with some examples:
	\paragraph{Old and young}
	Two women live alone on a deserted island. In order to survive, they have to do some basic activities like fetching water, fishing and cooking. The first woman is young, strong and educated. The second is older, less agile and rather uneducated. Thus, the first woman is faster, better and more productive in all productive activities. So she has an absolute advantage in all areas. The second woman, in turn, has an absolute disadvantage in all areas. In some activities, the difference between the two is large; in others, it is small.
	The law of comparative advantage states that it is not in the interest of either of them to work in isolation: They can both benefit from specialization and exchange. If the two women divide the work, the younger woman should specialize in tasks where she is most productive (e.g., fishing), while the older woman should focus on tasks where her productivity is only slightly lower (e.g., cooking). Such an arrangement will increase overall production and benefit both.
	
	\paragraph{The lawyer's typist}
	The famous economist and Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson (1915-2009) provided another example in his well-received textbook of economics, as follows: Suppose that in a given city the best lawyer also happens to be the best secretary. 
	However, if the lawyer focuses on the task of being a lawyer, and instead of practicing both professions at the same time, hires a secretary, both the lawyer's and the secretary's performance would increase because it is more difficult to be a lawyer than a secretary.\footnote{In the first eight editions the example comprised a
		male lawyer who was better at typing than his female secretary, but who had a comparative
		advantage in practising law. In the ninth edition published 1973, both lawyer and secretary were assumed to
		be female \citep[see][]{Backhouse2019Paul} Unfortunately, women are still discriminated against in introductory economics textbooks \citep[see][]{Stevenson2018Representations}.}
	
	

	
	
	\subsection{Autarky: An example of two different persons}\label{sec:exampleAB}
	
Assume that A and B want to produce and consume $y$ and $x$ respectively. Because of the complementarity of the two goods, each must be consumed in combination with the other. The utility function of both persons is $U_{\{A;B\}}=min(x,y)$. Both persons work for 4 time units, i.e., their \textit{units of labor} are $L_A=L_B=4$. A needs 1 units of labor to produce one unit of good $y$ and 2 units of labor to produce one unit of good $x$. B needs $\frac{4}{10}=0.4$ units of labor to produce one unit of good $y$ or good $x$. Thus, their \textbf{labor input coefficients}, which measure the units of labor required by a subject to produce one unit of good, are $a^A_y=1, a^A_x=2, a^B_y=0.4, a^B_x=0.4$:
			\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{lcc}\toprule
			&\multicolumn{2}{c}{Person}\\\cmidrule{2-3}
		input coefficient ($a$)	&A &B\\		\midrule
			Good $y$ & 1 & 0.4 \\
			Good $x$ & 2 & 0.4 \\\bottomrule
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}\medskip
%	Further assume the two persons aim to consume as much as possible of the two goods which are perfect complementary, i.e.,  That means, they want to consume the goods together in a bundle in a ratio 1:1 (like we do it with a left and a right shoe).

Spending all her time in the production of $y$, A can produce  $\frac{L_A}{a_y^A}=\frac{4}{1}=4$ units of $y$ and B can produce $\frac{L_B}{a_y^B}=\frac{4}{0.4}=10$ units of $y$.
Spending all her time in the production of $y$, A can produce  $\frac{L_A}{a_x^A}=\frac{4}{2}=2$ units of $x$and B can produce $\frac{L_B}{a_x^B}=\frac{4}{0.4}=10$ units of $x$.    
Knowing this, we can easily draw the production possibility frontier curves (PPF) of person A and B as shown in \autoref{fig:ppf}.

	Let us assume the two persons come together and try to understand how they can improve by jointly deciding which goods they should produce.

Their joint PPF curve can then be drawn in two ways:

If A produces only good $x$, as shown in \autoref{fig:ppfx}, we see that A and B can consume a total of 6 units of goods $x$ and $y$. This is less in total than in autarky, where A can consume $\frac{4}{3}$ units of each good and person B can consume $5$ units of each good, giving a combined consumption of $\frac{19}{3}=6,\bar{6}$. 
	
If A produces only good $y$, as shown in \autoref{fig:ppfy2}, we see that A and B can consume a total of 7 units of goods $x$ and $y$. Thus, both can be better off compared to autarky, since the total quantity distributed is larger. Thus, we have an \textbf{Pareto improvement} here because at least one person can be better off compared to autarky.

	\end{figure}

In \autoref{fig:ppfy}, the three possible consumption scenarios are marked with a dot and the PPFs of person A specializing in the production of good $x$ ($PPF_{A\rightarrow x}$) or good $y$ ($PPF_{A\rightarrow y}$) are also drawn. 
The scenario with person A specializing in the production of good $y$ is the output maximizing solution.\footnote{Note that this is also true for any other utility function, since $PPF_{A\rightarrow y}$ is always above $PPF_{A\rightarrow x}$.}

\subsubsection{Optimal production in cooperation} In order to produce the most bundles of both goods, the optimal cooperative production is 
				\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{lcc}\toprule
		&\multicolumn{2}{c}{Person} \\\cmidrule{2-3}
		production in cooperation	&A &B \\		\midrule
		Good $y$ & 4 & 3\\
		Good $x$ & 0 & 7 \\\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}\medskip


\subsubsection{Check for absolute advantage}
Employing 10 units of labor B can produce more of both goods and hence has an absolute advantage in producing $x$ and $y$. Formally, we can proof this by comparing the input coefficients of both countries in each good: 
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{lcccl}\toprule
		&\multicolumn{3}{c}{Person}&\\\cmidrule{2-4}
		absolute advantage	&A & &B& \\		\midrule
		Good $y$ & $a_y^A=1$ & > & $0.4=a_y^B$ & $\Rightarrow$ B has an absolute advantage in good $y$\\
		Good $x$ & $a_x^A=2$ & > & $0.4=a_x^B$ & $\Rightarrow$ B has an absolute advantage in good $x$ \\\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}\medskip

\subsubsection{Check for comparative advantage}
	The slope of the PPFs represent the \textit{marginal rate of transformation}, the terms of trade in autarky and the opportunity costs of a country. The opportunity costs are defined by how much of a good $x$ (or $y$) a person (or country) has to give up to get one more of good $y$ (or $x$). For example, A must give up $\frac{a_x^A}{a_y^A}=\frac{1}{2}=0.5$ of good $x$ to produce one more of good $y$. Thus, A's opportunity costs of producing one unit of $y$ is the production foregone, i.e., a half good $x$. 
	All opportunity costs of our example are:
	
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{lcc}\toprule
			&\multicolumn{2}{c}{Person}\\\cmidrule{2-3}
			opportunity costs of producing \dots	&A &B\\		\midrule
			\dots1 unit of good $y$: & $\frac{a_y^A}{a_x^A}=\frac{1}{2}=0.5$  (good x) & $\frac{a_y^B}{a_x^B}=\frac{0.4}{0.4}=1$ (good x) \\
			\dots1 unit of good $x$: & $\frac{a_x^A}{a_y^A}=\frac{2}{1}=2$  (good y) & $\frac{a_x^B}{a_y^B}=\frac{0.4}{0.4}=1$  (good y) \\\bottomrule
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}\medskip
	
Person A has a comparative advantage in producing good $y$ since A must give up less of good $x$ to produce one unit more of good $y$ than person B must. 
In turn, Person B has a comparative advantage in producing good $x$ since B must give up less of good $y$ to produce one unit more of good $x$ than person B must give up of good $y$ to produce one unit more of good $x$. 
Thus, every person has a comparative advantage and if both would specialize in producing the good in which they have a comparative advantage and share their output they can improve their overall output as was shown in \autoref{fig:ppfy}. 


%To explain what this means, denote $a^i_j$ the units of labor required by subject $i \in \{A,B\}$ to produce one unit of good $j\in \{x,y\}$. Since A can produce at most 4 units of good $y$ and 2 units of good $x$, we know that 
%	\[
%	a^A_y=1<a^A_x=2.
%	\]
%	Suppose A works 4 hours to produce good $x$, then he can produce four units of good $y$: $L_A/a^A_x=4/1=4$. 
%	
%	\red{Moreover, we know that \label{err:abverwechselt}
%		\[
%		a^B_y=0.4=a^B_x=0.4
%		\]
%		because with 4 units of labor, person B can produce 10 units of both goods.}
%	That means, individual B is more productive than A in producing good $y$ because $a^A_y>a^B_y$ and in producing good $x$ because $a^A_x>a^B_x$. 
	
%	However, A has a \textbf{comparative advantage} because 
%	\[
%	\frac{a^B_y}{a^B_x} \neq \frac{a^A_y}{a^A_x}.
%	\]
%	In particular, A (B) has a comparative advantage in producing good $y$ ($x$) because the ratio of the amount of labor required to produce a unit of $y$ to the amount of labor required to produce a unit of $x$ is lower for A compared to B:
%	\begin{align*}
%		\frac{a^B_y}{a^B_x} &> \frac{a^A_y}{a^A_x}.
%	\end{align*}
%	
%	Assuming both persons have 4 units of labor $(L_A=L_B=4)$, the labor input relations of both countries must be like this in order to get the PPF curves shown in \autoref{fig:ppf}:
%	\begin{align*}
%		\frac{a^B_y}{a^B_x} &> \frac{a^A_y}{a^A_x}\Leftrightarrow
%		\frac{0.4}{0.4} > \frac{1}{2} \Leftrightarrow 1> \frac{1}{2}.
%	\end{align*}
	
An alternative and more direct way to see the comparative advantages of A and B, respectively, is by comparing the two input coefficients of A with the two input coefficients of B: 
	\begin{align*}
		\frac{a^A_y}{a^A_x} &\lesseqqgtr \frac{a^B_y}{a^B_x} \quad	\Rightarrow \quad \frac{1}{2} <\frac{0.4}{0.4}.
	\end{align*}
Thus, A has a comparative advantage in $y$ and B in $x$.

\heux{Comparative advantage: Definition}{Economic subjects (e.g., individuals, households, firms, countries) should specialize in the production of that good in which they have a comparative advantage, that is, the ability of an economic subject to carry out a particular economic activity (e.g., producing goods) at a lower opportunity cost than a trade partner. 
	
%Two ways to check for the comparative advantage:

%\textbf{1. Opportunity costs:}
%
%		\itex{
%		\item $\frac{a^A_y}{a^A_x} < \frac{a^B_y}{a^B_x} \Rightarrow$  country A (B) has a comparative advantage in good y (x)
%		\item $\frac{a^A_x}{a^A_y} < \frac{a^B_x}{a^B_y} \Rightarrow$  country A (B) has a comparative advantage in good x (y)
%		\item $\frac{a^A_y}{a^A_x} = \frac{a^B_y}{a^B_x} \Rightarrow$  no country has a comparative advantage 
%		\item $\frac{a^A_x}{a^A_y} = \frac{a^B_x}{a^B_y} \Rightarrow$  no country has a comparative advantage 
%	}
%
%\textbf{2. Input coefficients:}

	\itex{
		\item $\frac{a^A_y}{a^A_x} > \frac{a^B_y}{a^B_x} \Rightarrow$  country A (B) has a comparative advantage in good x (y)
		\item $\frac{a^A_y}{a^A_x} < \frac{a^B_y}{a^B_x} \Rightarrow$  country A (B) has a comparative advantage in good y (x)
		\item $\frac{a^A_y}{a^A_x} = \frac{a^B_y}{a^B_x} \Rightarrow$  no country has a comparative advantage 
}
}

%In \autoref{fig:ppfy} we showed that it is output maximizing when both countries specialize in the production where they have a comparative advantage.


\subsubsection{Trade structure and consumption in cooperation}
If A specializes in the production of $y$, she must import some of good $y$, otherwise she cannot consume a bundle of both goods as desired. In turn, B wants to import some of the good $y$. 
B will not accept to consume less than 5 bundles of $y$ and $x$ as this was his autarky consumption. Thus, B wants a minimum of 2 units of good $y$ from A. A will not accept to give more than $4-\frac{4}{3}=2\frac{2}{3}$ items of good $y$ away and he wants at least $\frac{4}{3}$ items of good $x$. Overall, we can define three trade scenarios:

1. All gains from cooperation goes to A (see \autoref{fig:1winner}):

3. The gains from specialization and trade are shared by A and B: Some trade structure between the two shown above.

Each of the three cases yield a pareto-improvement, i.e., none gets worst but at least one gets better by mutually decide on production and redistribute the joint output. In the real world, however, it is often difficult for countries to cooperate and decide mutually on production and consumption. In particular, it is practically difficult to enforce redistribution of the joint outcome so that everyone is better off. 
So let's examine whether there is a mechanism that yields trade gains for both trading partners.

%
%In the example of \autoref{sec:exampleAB}, person A specializes in production where it has a comparative advantage in good $y$. To gain from specialization, A must export. Suppose A can convert one unit of good $y$ into one unit of good $x$ on the world market (which is B here). These terms of trade are represented by the red line in \autoref{fig:1winner}. Then, A exports 2 units of good $y$ and receives 2 units of good $x$ in return. In the end, it can consume 2 units of both goods. Since country B now produces 7 units of good $x$ and 3 units of good $y$, but exports 2 units of good $y$ and imports 2 units of good $x$, it remains at the same consumption level of 5 goods compared to autarky. Thus, person B does not benefit from trade in this scenario and thus has no incentive to trade.

%\paragraph{Can a general rule be derived from this example?}  Yes, B does not benefit here because it is incompletely specialized and the relative world prices, $\frac{p_y}{p_x}=1$, are the same for country B in autarky and free trade. Therefore, country B cannot benefit from trade because its specialization in good $x$ does not yield efficiency surpluses.
%%	\footnote{This would change if we assumed increasing returns to production.

%\paragraph{How can B also win?} Country A would also win on other terms of trade if they lie somewhere between the domestic terms of trade $(\frac{p_x}{p_y}=-\frac{2}{1})$ and the domestic terms of trade B $(\frac{p_x}{p_y}=-1)$.\\ For example, $\frac{p_x}{p_y}=-1.00000001$ would bring both in a winning scenario.

\subsection{The Ricardian model}
	To understand the underlying logic of the argument, let us formalize and generalize the situation of two subjects and their choices for production and consumption. In particular, the Ricardian Model build on the following assumptions:
	\itex{
		\item 2 subjects (A,B) can produce 2 goods (x,y) with 
		\item technologies with constant returns to scale.  Moreover, 
		\item production limits are defined by \[a_y^i Q_y^i+ a_x^i Q_x^i=L^i, \]
		where $a^i_j$ denotes the unit of labor requirement for person $i \in \{A,B\}$ in the production of good $j\in \{x,y\}$ and $Q^i_j$ denotes the quantity of good $j$ produced by person $i$, and 
		$Q^i_j$ the quantity of good $j$ produced by person $i$ and $Q^i_j$ the quantity of good $j$ produced by person $i$. (Imagine they both work 4 hours).
		\item Let $a^i_j$ denote the so-called labor input coefficients, i.e., the units of labor required by a person $i \in \{A,B\}$ to produce one unit of good $j\in \{x,y\}$.
		\item Suppose further that person B requires fewer units of labor to produce both goods, i.e., $a^A_y>a^B_y$ and $a^A_x>a^B_x$, and that
		\item a comparative advantage exists, i.e., $\frac{a^B_y}{a^B_x} \neq \frac{a^A_y}{a^A_x}$. 
	}

	\heux{Ricardian theorem}{
		If each country specialize in the production in the good for which it has a comparative advantage and exports this good, both countries gain from trade when the new world market price relation, $\frac{p^*_y}{p^*_x}$, lies between the price relations of both countries\footnote{In order to see that the relative prices within a country equals the relative productivity parameters, consider that nominal income of labor in producing good $j\in \{x,y\}$, $w_jL^i_j$, must equal the production value, that is, $p_j^ix_j^i$: 
			\[
			w_jL^i_j=p_j^ix_j^i.
			\]
			Setting $w_j=1$ as the numeraire and re-arranging the equation, we get
			\[ 
			p_j^i=\frac{L_j^i}{x_j^i}=a_j^i.

		\begin{align*}
			\frac{a^B_y}{a^B_x}  = \frac{p^B_y}{p^B_x} &> \frac{a^*_y}{a^*_x}= \frac{p^*_y}{p^*_x}> \frac{p^A_y}{p^A_x} = \frac{a^A_y}{a^A_x}

	\subsection{Distribution of welfare gains}
	The Ricardo theorem tells us nothing about the precise distribution of welfare gains. In this section, I will show that the distribution of welfare gains is the result of relative supply and demand in the world.
	
	To illustrate this, consider Ricardo's famous example\footnote{The example is explained by \citet{Academy2012International} in greater detail.} of two countries (England and Portugal) that can produce cloth $T$ and wine $W$ with different input requirements, namely:
	\begin{align*}
		\frac{p^P_W}{p^P_T}=\frac{a^P_W}{a^P_T}=\frac{8}{9}<\frac{12}{10}=\frac{a^E_W}{a^E_T}= \frac{p^E_W}{p^E_T}
	\end{align*}
	Thus, England has an absolute disadvantage in the production of both goods, but England has a \textit{comparative advantage in the production of cloth} and Portugal has a \textit{comparative advantage in the production of wine}. Let us further assume that both countries are similarly endowed with labor, $\bar{L}$. Then we can calculate the world supply of cloth and wine given relative world prices, $\frac{p_T}{p_W}$. Since we know that Portugal will only produce wine if the price of wine relative to cloth is above $\frac{p_W}{p_T}=\frac{8}{9}$ and England will only produce wine if the price of wine relative to cloth is above $\frac{p_W}{p_T}=\frac{12}{10}$, we can draw the relative world supply of goods as shown in the left panel of \autoref{fig:rica_dem1}. Note that $\alpha$ in the figure means $\frac{1}{a}$. Similarly, we can draw in the world supply of clothes, shown in the left panel of \autoref{fig:rica_dem1}.
	
	
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=.7\linewidth]{$HOME/Dropbox/hsf/pic/ie/rica_dem1_pdf}
		\captionof{figure}{World's relative supply}\label{fig:rica_dem1}\bigskip
	\end{center}
	
	Whether both countries specialize totally in the production of one good, or only one country does so depends on world demand for both goods at relative prices. Since we know from the Ricardo Theorem that the world market price relation, $\frac{p^{*}_T}{p^{*}_W}$, must be between the two autarky price relations:
	\[
	\frac{p^P_T}{p^P_W}>\frac{p^{*}_T}{p^{*}_W}> \frac{p^E_T}{p^E_W}.
	\]
	If world demand for cloth would be sufficiently high to have a world price of $\frac{p^P_T}{p^P_W}=\frac{9}{8}$ Portugal would not gain from trade. On the contrary, if world demand for wine would be sufficiently high to have a world price of $\frac{p^P_T}{p^P_W}=\frac{10}{12}$ England would not gain from trade. Thus, the price span between $\frac{10}{12}$ and $\frac{9}{8}$ says us which country gains from trade.  For example, at a world price of $\frac{p^{*}_T}{p^{*}_W}=1$ about 57\% 
	\red{$\left[\frac{\left(1-\frac{10}{12}\right)}{\left(\frac{9}{8}-\frac{10}{12}\right)}\approx 0.57 \right] $}
	of the gains through trade will be distributed to Portugal and about 43\% will be distributed to England.
	
	In \autoref{fig:rica_dem2}, I show two demand curves of the World. The dashed demand curve represents a world with a relative strong preference on wine and the other demand curve represents a relative strong demand for cloth. Since Portugal has a comparative advantage in producing wine, they would happy to live in a world where demand for wine is relatively high, whereas the opposite holds true for England.\bigskip

Thus, A has a comparative advantage in producing good $y$ and B has a comparative advantage in producing good $x$. This seems to be counterintuitive as B can produce faster anything and everybody else. 

When looking on input coefficients, we get
$$
\frac{a^A_y}{a^A_x}=\frac{10}{12} < \frac{9}{10}=\frac{a^B_y}{a^B_x}
$$
which gives us the same comparative advantages as described above.

To become an exporter of $y$, B needs to have lower opportunity costs in the production of $y$ than A. This can happen by becoming more productive in producing $y$ \textbf{and/or} by becoming 'slower' in producing good $x$ so that  $\frac{a_y^B}{a_x^B}<\frac{10}{12}$

	\subsection{Nobel prize winning theory}
	The Model which we discuss in this section is named after two Swedish economist, Eli Heckscher (1879-1952) and Bertil Ohlin (1899-1979). Bertil Ohlin received the Nobel Prize in 1977 (together with James Meade). The HO-Model, as it is often abbreviated, was the main reason for the price. 
	Here is an excerpt of the Award ceremony speech:
	\boxb{
		\begin{quotation}
			Your Majesties, Your Royal Highnesses, Ladies and Gentlemen,
			
			The question why individuals, firms and nations exchange goods and services with each other, and how these processes are influenced by government policies, may be regarded as the basic issue in the science of economics. In the case of exchange between countries, the dominating theory was for a long time – from the beginning of the 19th century – David Ricardo’s theory of comparative advantage. Ricardo explained there the structure of foreign trade by differences in the production technology between nations. Over the years the theory was gradually improved upon in various ways, but a more basic overhaul did not take place until Bertil Ohlin in the early 1930’s published his work Interregional and International Trade, which is now a classic, and James Meade in the 1950’s came out with his important volumes on The Theory of International Economic Policy.
			
			Bertil Ohlin showed in this work, which to some extent was inspired by a remarkable article by Eli Heckscher, that foreign trade may arise even if the production technology were identical in different nations. It is enough that the supplies of the factors of production of various kinds – such as labor of different types, capital, and land – differ among nations. The starting point of Ohlin’s theory is that a country tends to be an exporter of commodities that use relatively large amounts of the factors of production which are in ample supply as compared to domestic demand – in the hypothetical case without foreign trade. For instance, to take a simple example, if land is abundant in Australia while labor is relatively plentiful in England, we would expect Australia to be an exporter of commodities which for their production require much land, such as wool, while England would be an exporter of commodities the production of which requires relatively much labor, such as textiles.
			
			From this simple theoretical structure, the so-called Heckscher-Ohlin model, follow a number of interesting theorems. One of them, the factor price equalization theorem, tells us that foreign trade tends to equalize the prices of the factors of production in different countries. For instance, when Australia starts to export land-intensive goods, the demand for land goes up relative to labor, with a rise in land prices as a result, while the export of labor-intensive goods by England pulls up wages there relative to the price of land. Thus, trade in commodities tends to have the same effects on the prices of the factors of production as if the factors themselves could move freely between countries. In this sense, commodity trade is a substitute for international mobility of the factors of production. Another inference from Ohlin’s theory is that a tariff on a labor-intensive good, such as textiles, affects the distribution of income in favor of labor in the importing country, while a tariff on a capital-intensive commodity, such as wool or steel, results in an income redistribution in favor of the owner of capital.

	The Ricardo model explains international trade as advantageous because of comparative advantages that are the result of technological differences. This means that comparative advantage in the Ricardian model is solely the result of \textbf{productivity differences}. The size of a country or the size of the countries' endowments does not matter for comparative advantage in the Ricardian model because there is only one factor of production in Ricardian models, namely labor. However, the assumption that there is only one factor of production is unrealistic, and we should ask what happens \textbf{if there is more than one factor of production but no productivity differences}? 
	What happens if the two factors are available differently in different countries? What is the significance of endowment differences for international trade? And which owner of a factor of production will be a winner when a country opens up to world trade, and who will lose? The HO model can provide answers to these questions. 
	
	In \autoref{tab:endow}, I show that countries do indeed differ substantially in their total factor productivity, capital stock, and labor endowments, which are likely correlated with total population. 
	
	\pbn
	\subsection{The Heckscher-Ohlin (factor proportions) model}
	Assumptions:
	\enux{
		\item \textbf{Two countries}: Home country and foreign country. Variables referring to foreign countries are marked with an asterisk, $*$.
		\item \textbf{Two goods}: $x$ and $y$.
		\item \textbf{Two factors of production}: $K$ and $L$.
		This is new in relation to the Ricarkian model! Let's name the factors $K$ and $L$, which stands for capital and labor. 
		\item \textbf{Goods differ in terms of their need for factors of production}: $\frac{K_y}{L_y} \neq \frac{K_x}{L_x}.$\\
		This means that one good must be produced in a capital-intensive way and the other in a labor-intensive way. If we assume that good $y$ is capital intensive and good $x$ is labor intensive in production, we can write:
		\begin{align*}
			\frac{K_y}{L_y} > \frac{K_x}{L_x}.
		\end{align*}
		In this inequality, the quantity of capital required to produce good $y$, $K_y$, is on the left-hand side relative to the quantity of labor required to produce good $y$, $L_y$, i.e., the capital intensity of good $y$.The capital intensity of good $x$ is on the right-hand side of the inequality.  Rewriting this inequality, we can express it in terms of labor intensities:
		$\frac{L_y}{K_y} < \frac{L_x}{K_x}.$
		It should be clear that both inequalities say the same thing. 
		\item \textbf{No technology differences between countries}:\.
		Since we already know from Ricardian theory that productivity or technology differences are a source of international trade, we do not want to explain the same thing again with the HO model.  So we assume that all input coefficients are the same in all countries. 
		\item \textbf{Different relative factor endowments}: $\frac{K}{L} \neq \frac{K^*}{L^*}$\\
		Since countries are assumed to have different factor endowments, the model links a country's trade pattern to its endowment of factors of production. The capital-labor ratio in the home country, $\frac{K}{L}$, must differ from the ratio abroad.
		Suppose the home country is capital-rich and the foreign country is labor-rich. Then we have the following ratios between capital and labor in the two countries:
		\begin{align*}
			\frac{K}{L} > \frac{K^*}{L^*}.
		\end{align*}
		This means that the capital-labor ratio (a country's capital intensity) is higher in the home country than abroad.
		In terms of the ratio between labor and capital, i.e., the labor intensity of a country, this can be expressed as follows:
		$\frac{L}{K} < \frac{L^*}{K^*}.$
		It should be clear that both inequalities say the same thing. 
		
		\item \textbf{Free factor trade between sectors}
		Both factors can be used in the production of both goods. Note that cross-country movement of factors (migration, foreign direct investment) is not allowed.
		\item \textbf{No trade costs}
		Final products can be traded without any costs.
		\item \textbf{Equal tastes in countries and homothetic preferences}
		Consumers in both countries have the same utility function. Homothetic preferences simply mean that for given relative prices, income does not affect the ratio of consumption.
	}
	
	\pbn
	\subsection{Intuition}
	\itex{
		\item Consider that the home country has relatively more capital and the foreign country relatively more labor and that the good $y$ is capital intensive in production whereas the good $x$ is labor intensive. 
		\item Then it is relatively cheap for the home country to produce the capital-intensive good because it is endowed with a lot of capital, while it is relatively costly to produce the good with which the country is hardly endowed. 	
		\item Thus, the home country has a comparative advantage in producing the capital-intensive good.
		\item The opposite is true for the foreign country.
	}
	
	\heux{Heckscher-Ohlin Theorem}{
		The capital abundant country exports the capital-intensive good.
		The labor abundant country exports the labor-intensive good.\\
		Or:\\
		A country export goods that are intensive in its relatively abundant factor and will import goods that are intensive in its relatively scarce factor.
	}\medskip
	
	\itex{
		
		\item As a result of the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem, output of the good in which the country has a comparative advantage would increase. The capital intensive country will produce more capital intensive goods and the labor intensive country will produce more labor intensive goods.
		\item As the production of the good that makes intensive use of the abundant resource increases, the demand for that resource will also increase. Demand for the scarce resource will also increase, but to a lesser extent.
		\item If production of the good that intensively uses the scarce resource decreases, both abundant and scarce resources will be released, but relatively more of the scarce resource than of the abundant resource.
		\item In autarky, the relatively scarce factor in the home country was labor and factor prices were as follows:
		\[
		\frac{w}{r}>\frac{w^*}{r^*}
		\] 
		\item After opening to trade, production shifts to the home country so that the wage falls ($w\downarrow$) and the rent rises ($r\uparrow$).
		\item After opening to trade, production shifts abroad so that the wage rises, $w^*\uparrow$, and the rent falls, $w^*\downarrow$.
		\item This reallocation process, and hence the change in factor prices, continues until factor prices are equal in all countries:
		\[
		\frac{w}{r}=\frac{w^*}{r^*}
		\] 	
		\item \autoref{fig:hofactor} visualizes this line of reasoning. 
		\item I recommend a clip of Mike Moore explaining how trade based on factor endowments affects wages and returns to capital, see \tv \url{https://youtu.be/qk4tdP6ta78}

	\subsubsection{Why does the Factor-Price Equalization Theorem not (fully) hold?}
	In the real world, factor prices do not equalize due to frictions such as transportation costs, trade barriers, and the presence of goods that are rarely or never traded.
	
	\subsubsection{Trade as an alternative to factor movements }
	The factor price equalization theorem contains an interesting insight: if a country allows free trade in its products, it will automatically export the abundant factor indirectly in the form of goods that intensively use the abundant factor.

	From the Ricardian model, we know that trade is a positive-sum game. 
	If free trade is beneficial to a country, as Ricardo predicts, why isn't everyone happy with free trade? 
	In democratic societies, policymakers sometimes adopt protectionist trade policies because of pressure from interest groups and public demand. 
	The discrepancy between the promises and potential benefits of trade on the one hand and the negative consequences of free trade for many groups on the other is illustrated in \autoref{fig:freetradeatlast} \textit{Free trade at last}. The models so far do not give us a way to see which groups actually suffer from free trade, and thus we have no clue  why there are incentives for interest groups to oppose free trade. 
	Are anti-free trade policy preferences the result of ignorance, general worldviews, political ideology, environmental attitudes, social trust, or other factors? Well, these things may play a role, but there are also economic factors, i.e., the self-interest of individuals and groups within an economy, that can account for anti-free trade attitudes.
	In the following sections, we will discuss a theory that shows that while free trade benefits countries as a whole, not everyone within a country benefits equally. Some benefit more than others, and some are actually made worse off by free trade. 
	
	In the next two subsections, we derive some key hypotheses that free trade favors those people in a country who have abundant factors of production and disadvantages those who have scarce factors. Moreover, free trade favors investors and workers in export-oriented industries with comparative advantages.

	\subsubsection{Assumptions}
	The sector-specific model, also known as the Ricard-Viner model, can show that there are winners and losers in international trade. The model is based on the following assumptions:
	\enux{
		\item 2 countries $i \in \{A, B\}$
		\item 2 goods (sectors) $g \in \{1, 2\}$
		\item 3 factors of production: Labor $L$, capital specific to the production of good 1, $K_1$, and capital specific to the production of good 2, $K_2$\footnote{You can think of capital specific to the production of manufacturing goods (good 1) and land specific to the production of food sector goods (good 2)}.
		\ The technologies for the production of both goods are now represented by two
		production functions $Q_1=F_1(\bar{K_1},L_1)$ and $Q_2=F_2(\bar{K_2},L_2)$, where both factors of production have positive but decreasing marginal products
		\item The capital allocated to each sector is fixed for both countries: $K_1=\bar{K}_{1}, K_2=\bar{K}_{2}$
		\item The labor assigned to each sector ($L_1$ and $L_2$) can change in response to
		Response to external shocks: $\bar{L}=L_1+L_2$
		\item perfect competition
		\item perfect market clearing (no unemployment)
		\item country A is a small open economy (we consider only country A and therefore do not use a subscript for countries in the following)

		\paragraph{The production possibility frontier with two factor inputs:}
		The two production functions, the fixed endowments and the distribution of labor determine the aggregate PPF. The PPF, which is the product of two production functions ($F_1$ and $F_2$), is shown in \autoref{fig:ppftwo}. The figure shows, for both production points A and B, how the mobile factor of production, labor, must be reallocated from sector 2 to sector 1 in order to produce more of good 1 in production point B. The second and fourth quadrants show the respective production functions of sectors 1 and 2.

	\paragraph{Equillibrium in autarky:}
	\itex{
		\item Depending on a country's demand for good 1 and 2 a production point on the PPF is chosen at which it must hold that the slope of the PPF curve and the price relation (i.e., relation of marginal product of labor in sector 1 and sector 2) must be equal:
		\begin{align*}
			\frac{p_1}{p_2}=\frac{\frac{\partial F_2}{\partial L_2}}{\frac{\partial F_1}{\partial L_1}}
		\end{align*}
		\item What can we say about the rents of the production factors?
		\item From the assumption of perfect competition it follows that firms do not make a positive profit in equilibrium, $\pi\overset{!}{=}0$. Thus, the equilibrium wage for sectors $g \in \{1, 2\}$ are given by the profit maximizing of firms
		\begin{align*}
			\pi_g&=p_g\cdot F_g(\bar{K_g},L_g)-w_gL_g-r_gK_g\\
			\frac{\partial \pi_g}{\partial L_g}&= p_g\cdot \frac{\partial F_g}{\partial L_g}-w_g\overset{!}{=}0 \qquad
			\Leftrightarrow w_g=p_g\frac{\partial F_g}{\partial L_g}
		\end{align*}
		\item We know that labor can move freely between sectors and an equilibrium exists when there are no incentives to move any further. That is the case when wages in both sectors are equal, $w_1=w_2$. 
		Thus, we can express wages in terms of purchasing power in units of good 1 as follows: 
		\begin{align*}
			w_1&=p_1\frac{\partial F_1}{\partial L_1}\qquad \textnormal{ and } \qquad w_2=p_2\frac{\partial F_2}{\partial L_2}\\
			\Rightarrow w&=p_1\frac{\partial F_1}{\partial L_1}=p_2\frac{\partial F_2}{\partial L_2}\\
			\Leftrightarrow \frac{w}{p_1}&=\frac{\partial F_1}{\partial L_1}\\
			\Leftrightarrow \frac{w}{p_2}&=\frac{\partial F_2}{\partial L_2}
		\end{align*}
		\item \autoref{fig:eqaut} presents the equilibrium wage and the optimal allocation of labor into sector 1 and 2.

	\paragraph{Equilibrium under free trade:}
	Assume the price of good 1 and good 2 increase due to a trade opening in the same proportion. What happens with the real wage and the real incomes of capital-1 and capital-2 owners? The answer is: no real changes occur. 
	\itex{\item The wage rate, $w$, rises in the same proportion as the prices, so the real wages are unaffected. In \autoref{fig:ppftwo} this can be shown by shifting both curves upward.
		\item The real incomes of capital owners also remain the same because there will be no reallocation of labor across sectors.}
	Now, assume only the price of good 1 rises for 10\% while $p_2$ remains fixed, $\frac{p'_1}{p_2}>\frac{p_1}{p_2}$.  What happens with the real wage and the real incomes of capital-1 and capital-2 owners? The answer is: some win, some lose, and some maybe win.
	
	\textbf{Wages:}
	\itex{
		\item $p_1\frac{\partial F_1}{\partial L_1}$ rises and hence labor reallocates from sector 2 to sector 1 ($L_1\uparrow$ and $L_2\downarrow$). This is shown in \autoref{fig:eqfree}.
		\item This reallocation of labor has some implications for the real wages measured in purchasing power of good 1 and 2, respectively:
		\item The price of good 1 has increased by 10\%, the wage has however increased by less than 10\% (compare the length of BC and BD in the figure), whereas the price for food stays constant. 
		\item  Thus, the purchasing power in buying good 2 increased, whereas the purchasing power in buying good 1 decreased. Hence, workers gain when buying good 2 but lose when buying good 1
		\item Overall, the welfare effect from real wages is unclear and depends on preferences.
	}
	\textbf{Owner of capital-1:}
	\itex{\item Owners of capital-1 receive a 10\% higher price on their products but have to pay a less than 10\% higher wage.
		\item Overall, capital-1 owners gain from free trade because they can employ more workers (at a higher price) now.
	}
	\textbf{Owner of capital-2:}
	\itex{\item Owner of capital-2 receive the same price on their products but have to pay a higher wage.
		\item Overall, capital-2 owners lose from free trade because they can employ less workers at a higher price now.
